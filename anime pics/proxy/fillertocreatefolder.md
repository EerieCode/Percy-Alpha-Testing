# Percy Alpha Testing
For Percy's beta scripts before they are beta

Basically, this is a repo for the scripts of cards that have just been revealed (and most definitely not Percy's version of FH's pre-script repo): I figured using Git for this would be a more efficient way for us scripters to write, test and update them. There aren't many rules for this repo, but it'd be better if we keep the scripts separated by set (kinda like in that other repo I'm most definitely not ripping off), this way it will be easier to take them later. Also, even if a card has a passcode at the bottom left, please use the beta ID anyway, K? Toodles!
