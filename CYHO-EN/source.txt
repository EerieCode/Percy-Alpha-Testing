Bigfoot
You can reveal this card in your hand; your opponent randomly chooses 1 card from your entire hand, then you discard the chosen card. Then, if the discarded card was not "Danger! Bigfoot", Special Summon 1 "Danger! Bigfoot" from your hand, and if you do, draw 1 card. If this card is discarded: You can target 1 face-up card your opponent controls; destroy it. You can only use this effect of "Danger! Bigfoot" once per turn.
